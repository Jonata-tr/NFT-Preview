## My process

I tried to make it as coherent as possible, flex was a really cool way to organize everything. Also I used the basics to finish everything, I hope it's good enough.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flex
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about flex as a organization methoed, it make possible to do a realy clean interface and a realy good flow for the "coding". 

### Continued development


I want to try to learn about grid, at the moment I only use grid as a centering method, but this project would be much better with grid... I think so.
